Maintainer: Jennifer M. Franks <franksjenniferm@gmail.com>
Description: Currently, there is a lack of effective methods designed to 
    eliminate platform-based bias. Our package is designed to quantile normalize
    each feature in a data set according to its corresponding feature in a
    target distribution. This eliminates distribution based differences
    resulting from the use of different gene expression profiling platforms.
